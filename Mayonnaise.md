### Ingredients:
* 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature 30 minutes
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon cold water
* 3/4 cup olive or vegetable oil (or a combination), divided
* 1 teaspoon white-wine vinegar or cider vinegar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper

### Preparation:
Whisk together yolk, mustard, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until combined well. Whisk
in a teaspoon of cold water to the mix. Add about 1/4 cup oil drop by drop,
whisking constantly until mixture begins to thicken. Whisk in vinegar and lemon 
juice, then add remaining 1/2 cup oil in a very slow, thin stream, whisking 
constantly until well blended. If at any time it appears that oil is not being
incorporated, stop adding oil and whisk mixture vigorously until smooth, then 
continue adding oil. Whisk in salt to taste and white pepper. Chill, surface
covered with plastic wrap, until ready to use. 

#### Cooks' notes:
The egg yolk in this recipe is not cooked, which may be of concern if salmonella
is a problem in your area. Â· Mayonnaise keeps, covered and chilled, 2 days.
